# Recipe-Page

Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page
  An staic aesthetically pleasing looking website which has the recipe to create an delicious omelette.
  Not much functionality but rather making it look good and responsive.

Challenge:
  I got stuck and had to think about the list element's marked pseudo selector and how it's relationship with list item affects them both. It was mind wrecking and a little annoying but I got the gist of it.

Build with:
  HTML, CSS, Github.
